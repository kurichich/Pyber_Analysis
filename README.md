# Pyber Ride Sharing App

## Overview of the Analysis

Pyber is a ride sharing app company.  We have been asked to analyze
 data in csv files, which contain information about 3 types of cities and specific data regarding 
 each ride over a period of time.   The results of the analysis will help Pyber improve access to ride
 sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Python scripts were written using Pandas libraries, the jupyter notebook and matplotlib to establish
 a relationship between the type of city and number of drivers and riders.  Specifically, the attached
 analysis compiled the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type.

Finally, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type was calculated.

## Results

Description of the differences in ride sharing data among the city types

 - The highest number of rides were found in populated Urban city types.  However, the highest average fares per 
  ride were found outside of cities in Rural areas.

 - The total rides, based on city type, were the highest in Urban cities (1,625), followed by Suburban (625)
  and Rural (125).

  - This indicated the total drivers would be highest in a similar sequence, with Urban cities having the most
  drivers (2,405), followed by Urban (490) and Rural (78).

  - Total fares corresponded to the total rides: Suburban ($39,854.38), Urban ($19,356.33) and Rural ($4,327.93).

  - The average fare per ride, however, was the highest in Rural areas ($34.62/ride), followed by Suburban 
  ($30.97/ride) and Urban ($24.53/ride).

  - Similarly, the average fare per driver correlated with the average fare: Rural ($55.49), Suburban ($39.50), 
  and Urban ($16.57).
